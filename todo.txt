still need it to say 'wrong colour' when you input wrong colour 
    eg 'play g a2' illegal move: r c3 wrong colo

needs to work with gogui regression testing

wrong color issue: player_errors wants an int, but there is not direct integer for evert letter
so wont send letter to the function, but cant alter it into an int
